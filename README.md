# Farmer's Adventure
The official GitHub page for my Farmer's Adventure Curseforge modpack. ALSO: This modpack was made in 3 days, it is expected to have issues!
This is the first modpack I've created (with intent of posting to Curseforge) and the first repository I've created on Github, so please leave any feedback in the issue tracker section or in the comment section of my YouTube channel.

# Description
Farmer's Adventure is a small farming adventure-based modpack focusing on Farmer's Delight and modded additions to it, ranging from Farmer's Respite (lumpazl) to End's Delight (foggyhillside). Players go on a trip to cook every single meal the modpack has to offer while expanding their Minecraft knowledge while doing so. Farmer's Adventure is a non-profit passion project made to be played with friends, so mods are added to help you do exactly that. This means no paying for bitcoin-miner servers off of sketchy websites you find on the front page of google. Just host a world and invite away (using essential, essential.gg). Sky is the limit, and partially your hoe durability. This modpack is supposed to be played with OptiFine which can be found at optifine.net. 

# Requirements
At least 4 GB of RAM is allocated to this modpack.
A somewhat decent PC.
Minecraft (pretty given).

# Quest Book
The FTB Quest Book was the first thing created in the entire modpack and as such will be somewhat dated in future versions. I expect to update the quest book every once in a while based on feedback that can leave in the issues section. Sorry if something in it is too hard to achieve, I intentionally made it so things are more complex than they might seem.

# Playing with Friends
I intentionally added FTB Teams and Essential to help with multiplayer accessibility. Please use this instead of anything else! Essential has built-in plugins that allow you to invite "friends" into a world you host from in-world!
